Intro to programming class
# Hello, My name is Jordan Shakespeare
This Repository exists as a place to save my assignments from my intro to programming class.
I am very new to programming but I am eager to learn as I find it very fun and rewarding.
I chose the software development program at southwest techincal college because it was better alternitive than a university for me. As I've learned more and more about programming I have become more and more excited to become a software developer. My end goal is to become a full fledged software developer and learn learn and use as many programming languages as I can.
